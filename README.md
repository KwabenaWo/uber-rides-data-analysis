# Uber Rides Data Analysis 🚗📊

Welcome to the Uber Rides Data Analysis project! In this project, we explore the fascinating world of Uber trips to uncover insights into how people use the service. Through rigorous analysis of ride categories, purposes, distances, and more, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of Uber user behavior.

## Overview ℹ️

Uber has revolutionized the way we travel, offering convenient transportation options at our fingertips. But what drives people to use Uber? How far do they travel, and for what purposes? This project seeks to answer these questions and more by analyzing a dataset containing information about Uber rides.

## Project Structure 📁

- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- `uber_rides_dataset.csv`: CSV file containing the raw data of Uber rides.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and its findings.

## Getting Started 🚀

To replicate our analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
3. Open and run the `data_analysis.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.

Happy analyzing! 📈
